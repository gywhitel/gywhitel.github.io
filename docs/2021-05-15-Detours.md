title: Detours I take while configuring Jekyll

# Title
This is a test file. It looks easy to create a Github pages blog, yet I found it complicated when implementing it, probably because of my lack of knowledge about frontend.

The real problem arises from Jekyll themes. I used Jekyll themes hosted on Github, which seems get better support from GitHub pages.
I `gem install` the theme `just-the-docs` locally in gem default path (those template folders not in my Jekyll sites folder) and copy those folders into my Jekyll sites.

It seems I don't have to upload template folders since the `_config.yml` specify the theme as `remote-theme`. 
But the automatics builds on Github fails.

好像不应该`Jekyll new`不要初始化目录，初始化了没法用人家的了。看了很多不同的教程，最后还相互掣肘了。
