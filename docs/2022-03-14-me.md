## Computational Fluid Dynamics Based on 3D Reconstruction of Objects
*At Dalian University of Technology*    [Dec 2018 - Jun 2019]

The project aims to provide digital twins that can reflect the fluid field around real objects. I used active stereo 3D vision for the reconstruction of testing objects. The CAD models of testing objects can be obtained after postprocessing on their meshes. Then I conduct computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations using the CAD models.

On the other hand, I built a small wind tunnel system for wind tunnel testing of objects. The flow structures were quantitively measured by particle image velocimetry (PIV) imaging techniques. The flow structures in the CFD simulation and in the wind tunnel testing are similar, which justifies
the reconstruction-to-simulation method.

## Robot Teleoperation Controlled by Human Body Motions
*At Intelligent Robot Laboratory, Dalian University of Technology*

# Teaching experience
*Whittle School and Studios, Shenzhen, China*

I was the studio teacher of Creating Games and Animations, Autumn 2020. This is a hands-on,
project-focused course that brings students STEM education. I was the teacher of a class of 16 2nd-
3rd grade students, teaching them scratch, a GUI-based programming language. I developed ten
lessons that cover basic programming concepts using scratch. In the final project, students divided
into groups to develop a game using scratch and give a demonstration of their game.
